# palantir-alignment Repository Setup

## What was done

- Initialized a new git repository in the `palantir-alignment` directory.

## Why it was done

- To enable version control, align with MCP-first and code hygiene standards, and prepare the project for collaborative and traceable development.

## How it was tested

- Ran `git status` to verify the repository was initialized and the working tree is clean.

### Proof of Completion

```
Command: git status
Result:
On branch master
No commits yet
nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)
```

---

- `.git` directory is present.
- No duplicate or stale files detected at initialization.
- This file documents the setup, reasoning, and verification as required by project standards.
